# Multiple Futures Prediction

This software project accompanies [Multiple Futures Prediction](https://arxiv.org). (NeurIPS 2019)

## About
Multiple Futures Prediction is a framework for multimodal temporal trajectory predictions. Multi-agent interactions are taken into account and the model learns multimodality without explicit annotations. It currently achieves state-of-the-art on three vehicle forecasting datasets.
